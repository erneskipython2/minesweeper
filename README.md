    -I added info project properties
    -I added mongodb, actuator and some other common props, added actuator dep for prod ready features
    -I added the SessionGame model class for describe a party persistence and tests for this pojo works as expected.
    -I improved the last test coverage for SessionGame class
    -Removed .DS_Store
    -As I'm going to create now some functional features I'm going to follow with some basic branch strategies dev/staging/master, pushing to remote, and change to dev branch 
    -Created the repository layer and basic rest controller for create a new party
    -Added basic persistence interface for SessionGame
    -Added basic service interface for SessionGame available operations
    -Added basic TDD tests and implementation for RED / GREEN / REFACTOR SessionGameService
    -Added functional implementation for createParty

    -Added logic for find user parties and a specific party with testing
    -Added basic rest controller with create(post) and update(put) game, create basic http auth config, create endpoints in props and postman init collections for testing api in docs/ folder
    -Added rest controller for get parties and party, testing and updated collections
    -Added BoardSettings model with some default constructors for levels and tests
    
    -Added Field model for describe every cell and logic for generate the board and fill the mines randomly and a handy printer helper
